# Triangle Calculator

This is a calculator to solve triangles based on known measurements. If you know a few angles and sides of a triangle, the rest can be solved using the rules of triangle geometry.

To use, enter the known lengths and angles, and the rest will be computed.

## How it works

All angles and sides of a triangle can be solved if any of the following is known:

* Three sides
* Two sides and the angle they share
* Two sides and an angle they don't share (sometimes)
* Two angles and any side

If any of the above are known, the Law of Sines and Law of Cosines can be used to figure out the rest.

### Law of Sines

The law of sines says that...

### Law of Cosines

The law of cosines says that...
